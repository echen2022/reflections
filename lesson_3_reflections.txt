What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  When you initialize a repository you need to check your previous commands and what you have downloaded. You need to do this to make sure you have everything that is needed.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  Staging area is the middle area where you can group things together and commit them as one. This could be helpful by controlling what is committed and saving space.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
  You can group things together and see what is going to be committed.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
  Branches could help you stay organized because you can easily see how things have changed or you can go back and edit only one mode

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
  They can help by making it clear how things are related and what is missing or detached.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
  When two branches are merged together, I believe that git will combine the commands. It is represented the way it is so we can see what has been merged and what there still is.


What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
  Git will not know what commands to keep so you are able to do this by hand but git can make it much more efficient
